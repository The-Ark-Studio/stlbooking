## Docker Environment Setup

Creating separate Docker environments for local development, testing, staging, and production is a smart way to manage your projects. It keeps each environment isolated, ensuring consistency and stability across the development lifecycle.

### Local Docker
- **Purpose**: Local development and debugging.
- **Configuration**: Includes all necessary dependencies for development, such as debugging tools and code editors.
- **Docker Compose File**: `docker-compose.local.yml`

### Development Docker
- **Purpose**: Integration testing and continuous integration (CI).
- **Configuration**: Similar to the local environment but optimized for automated testing and integration processes.
- **Docker Compose File**: `docker-compose.dev.yml`

### Staging Docker
- **Purpose**: Pre-production environment to test features before release.
- **Configuration**: Mirrors the production environment as closely as possible.
- **Docker Compose File**: `docker-compose.staging.yml`

### Production Docker
- **Purpose**: Live environment serving end-users.
- **Configuration**: Optimized for performance, security, and scalability.
- **Docker Compose File**: `docker-compose.prod.yml`

### Implementation Steps

1. **Separate Configuration Files**: Maintain separate Docker Compose files for each environment. This keeps your configurations clean and environment-specific.
    ```sh
    # Local environment
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up
    
    # Development environment
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
    
    # Staging environment
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up
    
    # Production environment
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
    ```

2. **Environment Variables**: Use environment-specific
